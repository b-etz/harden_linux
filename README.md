# Ubuntu / Debian Linux Security Hardening Scripts

## What Is This?
The primary contribution from this fork is an unattended Linux hardening script. Some opinionated removals/additions of tools and policies have happened -- this is mostly for my personal use.

Security is an ongoing process. Regularly review your system's security settings, keep your system updated, and stay informed about new security practices and vulnerabilities.
